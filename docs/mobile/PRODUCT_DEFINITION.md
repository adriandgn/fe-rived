*   **Consumers (The Curators):** Want endless inspiration in their pocket and the ability to quickly save or interact with ideas they love.

## 3. Core Value Proposition (Mobile First)

*   **Visual Immersion:** A full-screen, touch-first browsing experience that puts the fashion front and center.
*   **Instant Connection:** Real-time notifications and easier interactions (taps/swipes) to build community.
